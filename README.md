#### What I learned

For this project I challenged myself to recreate the design without the use of javascript. There were a few elements of the design that were difficult for me. First the vector image. As the size of the screen changes the position of the vector image changes and a box is added or removed. Furthermore the vector is actually seperate pieces put into specific areas. To recreate the desktop layout in particular I Imported the images into Adobe illustrator and traces over different parts of the vector with the provided images to figure out the sizing. 

To actually lay the images out I then used relative and absolute positionings to position the vectors. 

To make the FAQ accordion work I found a cool solution [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42267467/how-to-toggle-effect-in-div-using-only-css) I did see other's use an anchor tag. Would love to hear why this may be a more elegant solution.
